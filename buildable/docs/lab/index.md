# Lab Instructions

This lab is composed of multiple different challenges that demonstrate some sort of network pivoting to reach the end goal of accessing resources on an internal network.

## What Is Pivoting?

Network pivoting, also known as lateral movement or network hopping, is a technique used by attackers to extend their control and access across multiple systems within a network. It involves gaining unauthorized access to one or more systems on a target network and then using those compromised systems as stepping stones to access other systems within the same network.
